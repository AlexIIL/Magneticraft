**Small Steam Engine**

One of the first ways to generate electricity in Magneticraft. As the name suggests, it generates electricity from steam.

It requires a minimum of 10mb of steam per tick in order to operate. If it is getting less than that, it will store the steam until it reaches 10mb of steam. The more steam it has, the more electricity it will generate. Up to a maximum of 80mb/t of steam which will generate 160Watts.

To generate the steam you will need a combustion chamber and a steam boiler on top, the combustion chamber only accepts coal or charcoal and the boiler needs water and auto-ejects the steam to the block on top.

*NOTE*: it has blocks 1 level below the base block
