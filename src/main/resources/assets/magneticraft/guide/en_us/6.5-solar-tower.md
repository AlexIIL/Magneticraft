# Solar Tower

This multiblock creates steam using the heat provided by [solar mirrors](6.4-solar-mirror.md).
The steam can be used for energy in a [steam engine](6.1-small-steam-engine.md).

The structure requires water in the blue connector and automatically expels steam in the orange connector.

The max production of the tower is 1200 mB of steam per tick. 
Every mirror creates 8 Heat units per tick, a heat units translates to 2J or 2Rf, so a mirror creates 16J per tick.
